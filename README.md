# Cross-Platform R Shiny Docker Images

This project focuses on creating Docker images for R Shiny applications that are optimized for cross-platform compatibility. By leveraging arm-based Docker images, we aim to achieve cost savings on AWS Graviton2 instances, which offer up to 40% better price-performance compared to traditional amd64 CPU architectures. Additionally, this project seeks to support the growing number of developers using Apple Silicon-based computers, by improving the developer workflow on these devices.

## Dockerfiles

The project includes two Dockerfiles designed for different CPU architectures:

- `Dockerfile` : For amd64 architectures.
- `Dockerfile.arm` : For arm architectures.

## Building Docker Images Locally

To build the Docker images for both amd64 and arm architectures, use the following commands:

**For amd64:**

`docker build -t hello:latest .`

**For arm:**

`docker build -f Dockerfile.arm -t hello:latest .`

## Running with Docker Compose

You can launch the application using Docker Compose, with separate configurations for arm and amd64 architectures:

For arm:

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.arm.yml up --build -d`

For amd64:

`docker-compose up --build -d`

## Using Pre-Built Images

For convenience, pre-built images are available and can be run directly:

`docker run -d -p 3838:3838 --name hello awspunk/hello:latest`

Once the container is running, the R Shiny application can be accessed at: http://localhost:3838/

The repository provides Docker images for both arm and amd64 architectures. Docker will automatically select the appropriate image based on your machine's CPU architecture, facilitating seamless deployment across different platforms.
